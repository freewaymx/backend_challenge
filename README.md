# BackEnd Challenge (Coffee Shop)
This repo will contain the backend challenge code, which is a small Coffee shop API (OPTIONAL GraphQL)

## Index


## Goal
The goal of this Challenge is to create a WEB API that allow us to login, Sign In and Log Out users, create/update/list coffee products

| products | Many - Many relation | True       | True  | This should have a *-* relations with the products (Create another table) |
### Business Logic
User model should be one one table, with a `type` field which should contain the info to know if it's admin or not. TIP: This is STI (Single Table Inheritance) in RoR.

## Requirements
- [ ] Use RoR (Ruby on Rails)
- [ ] Use device gem for auth
- [ ] Use postgreSQL as DB
- [ ] Create a postman/insomnia collection for all API calls (Bonus points if you use global variables)
- [ ] Cover all the Technical Details and User Stories
- [ ] Create a unit test (At least one success and failure per endpoint)

## How to start?
Use the following steps:
1. Create your OWN branch from `master`, you can name it as: `base/your_user_name`. Example: `base/aherredev`
2. You have to keep your changes inside of your branch, NEVER send changes to `master` branch pls.
3. I highly recommend to create 1 branch from your base branch, each time that you want to add a big feature (1 new endpoint for example). For example, if I want to create a endpoint to Log In, I should:
  - Make sure that I'm using my base branch
  - Create a new branch from my base branch, the name can be: `feat/name-of-the-feature`
  - Submit my changes to my recently created branch (`feat/name-of-the-feature`)
  - Create a PR from `feat/name-of-the-feature` to `base/your_user_name`
  - Ask for CR to @alberto or @aherredev
  - Squash and merge the PR if it's accepted
