# BackEnd Challenge (Coffee Shop)
This repo will contain the backend challenge code, which is a small Coffee shop API (OPTIONAL GraphQL)

## Index


## Goal
The goal of this Challenge is to create a WEB API that allow us to login, Sign In and Log Out users, create/update/list coffee products

### Bonus points
Allow to purchase coffee products (create a record of each purchase and save/update the products stock)

## User Stories
> Use this as a general guidance while you are thinking on how design the API

## Technical Details
> You can get an idea of the params and data that you will recive and return

## Resources
> You could use this posts as a reference or just investigate by your own

## Requirements
- [ ] Use RoR (Ruby on Rails)
- [ ] Use device gem for auth
- [ ] Use postgreSQL as DB
- [ ] Create a postman/insomnia collection for all API calls (Bonus points if you use global variables)
- [ ] Cover all the Technical Details and User Stories
- [ ] Create a unit test (At least one success and failure per endpoint)

## How to start?
Use the following steps:
> 
1. Create your OWN branch from `master`, you can name it as: `base/your_user_name`. Example: `base/aherredev`
2. You have to keep your changes inside of your branch, NEVER send changes to `master` branch pls.
3. I highly recommend to create 1 branch from your base branch, each time that you want to add a big feature (1 new endpoint for example). For example, if I want to create a endpoint to Log In, I should:
  - Make sure that I'm using my base branch
  - Create a new branch from my base branch, the name can be: `feat/name-of-the-feature`
  - Submit my changes to my recently created branch (`feat/name-of-the-feature`)
  - Create a PR from `feat/name-of-the-feature` to `base/your_user_name`
  - Ask for CR to @alberto or @aherredev
  - Squash and merge the PR if it's accepted
